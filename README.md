# Vim Adventurous

A dark vim color theme using common colours often seen in the cult series Adventure Time.

![Adventure Time!](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120811190505/adventuretimewithfinnandjake/images/2/24/Ci_banner_2k12mar20_adventuretime.jpeg)

Based on the [Dracula syntax theme](https://draculatheme.com/).

**Why?** Because Adventure Time's colours are crisp and awesome!

**How?** This is automatically generated! It takes Dracula's colours and matches them with
a different colour palette.
